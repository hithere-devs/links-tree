				<h2 className='text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-white'>Summary</h2>
				<p className='mb-4 text-justify'>
					üöÄ As an Associate Backend Developer at Reachinbox, I worked on
					optimizing high-scale email analytics systems handling millions of
					mails per day. Implemented robust logging infrastructure using EFK
					stack (Elastic, FluentD, Kibana) and NewRelic for monitoring. Through
					strategic DB optimizations and query improvements, I achieved 70-90%
					reduction in API response times across services. Tech stack included
					Node.js, Express, MySQL for the main product, with additional
					experience in TimescaleDB for time-series data optimization.
				</p>

				<p className='mb-4 text-justify'>
					‚ö° Later, I contributed to Zapmail - a cutting-edge automation product
					built with TypeScript, Node.js, BullMQ, Redis, PostgreSQL, Docker, and
					Kafka. Developed innovative features using Playwright for headless
					browser automations and designed core functionalities like workspace
					management. Implemented sophisticated queueing architectures for
					handling complex workflows between microservices, particularly for
					Google Workspace exports to third-party tools. üõ†Ô∏è The role involved
					extensive work with modern backend technologies and cloud
					infrastructure.

					How did I get the Job? üéØ
				</h2>

				<p className='mb-4 text-justify'>
					There were multiple rounds of interviews, starting with a assignment,
					a technical interview after a call with the HR, and a final round with
					the CEO/CTO. üîÑ
				</p>
				<h3 className='text-lg font-bold mb-4 text-white'>
					Assignment Round üìù
				</h3>
				<p className='mb-4 text-justify'>
					Task was to build an Email Warmup tool using the google apis and
					microsoft outlook apis. Difficult to deal with the azure auth cause
					there was less to no documentation on it at that moment. So had to
					somehow try and test different approaches to make it work, managed to
					complete it in a week and submit that. They liked it and I got a call
					back for the next round. üí™
				</p>
				<h3 className='text-lg font-bold mb-4 text-white'>
					HR Call & Techinal Round
				</h3>
				<p className='mb-4 text-justify'>
					HR called me and asked me about my previous work experience, why do I
					need to join basic stuff and later scheduled a technical round with a
					senior. In the technical round I was asked about the assignment, how
					did I approach it, what were the challenges I faced, how did I solve
					them, and some basic questions on the techstack I used in the
					assignment. I was also asked about my previous work experiences,
					followed by a live coding ques basic leetcode question, which I was
					able to tell the approach but not solve it. I struggle with DSA as I
					already told them, and he gave me another function implementation
					which I did! So after that I wasn&apos;t sure If I&apos;ll get a call
					or not but luckily I got a call for the final round.
				</p>
				<h3 className='text-lg font-bold mb-4 text-white'>
					Round with the CTO & Offer
				</h3>
				<p className='mb-4 text-justify'>
					We had a good discussion about the products they have been working on,
					problems they are facing and from me he wanted to know what are my
					motivations to join reachinbox, my future goals etc. He was happy with
					my answer and told me about some good problems he would like me to
					work on if I join them. His focus was that there was no work-life
					balance kind of thing when joining them, which I was hesitant about
					earlier but I was ready to take the challenge as it was early in my
					career and learn as much as I can. So when I got the offer via HR I
					accepted and joined them in May 2024. Offer was for an Internship but
					actually expecting me to work like full time job, after 3 months
					transition into full time role. I have discussed later why did I not
					join full time there.

					Techstack & Challenges faced during work! üõ†Ô∏è
				</h2>
				<p className='mb-4 text-justify'>
					So based on different things I worked on I can explain what techstack
					did I use! Initially when I joined the company I was assigned a
					Javascript, Node, Express based codebase with MySQL as the db for the
					first project which was the backend microservice for Reachinbox.ai,
				</p>
				<h3 className='text-lg font-bold mb-4 text-white'>Logging Setup üìä</h3>
				<p className='mb-4 text-justify'>
					While I was going through the codebase and understanding the
					architecture I was assigned with a side task which was to do R&D and
					build a robust logging system for all thier microservices, I got to
					learn about the different logging libraries and how to implement them
					in a microservice architecture. My manager gave me this as I already
					worked on similar task in my prevoius job @ Openinapp, but this time
					he gave me a different techstack for it - EFK, (Elastic, FluentD,
					Kibana). I did a POC using dockerised setup of EFK and then
					implemented it in the codebase.
				</p>
				<h3 className='text-lg font-bold mb-4 text-white'>
					Backend Microservice & DB Optimizations ‚ö°
				</h3>
				<p className='mb-4 text-justify'>
					After the first week I went on to build some features/apis and fix
					bugs for the backend codebase I was given to work on! I collaborated
					with the frontned team for different page APIs bugs, new features etc.
					I had a discussion in the interview about how I helped to reduce the
					db queries and optimized the db for better performance at my prev
					company, and they were facing a similar problem with thier data as
					well, so next major thing I worked on apart from building new APIs and
					solving bugs was to optimise the db queries, indexing, improvement in
					the schema based on the usecase in the queries, like aggregations,
					seperating the time series data to a new database named timescale if I
					remember correctly, reducing response times by huge margin, like as an
					example, for a high freq user data loads on the dashboard took
					infinite time to load, I reduced it to less than 10 seconds, which was
					a huge improvement, similarly for marginally low freq user data loads
					became lightning fast.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-4 text-justify'>
					After this I was assigned to work on a new project which was in works
					named Zapmail, this was based on Typescript, Node, Express, BullMQ,
					Redis, PostgreSQL, Docker, Kafka etc. relatively the new techstack
					which was a relief for some reason ü§´
				</p>
				<h3 className='text-lg font-bold mb-4 text-white'>
					Headfull Automations with Playwright ü§ñ
				</h3>
				<p className='mb-4 text-justify'>
					This new product is trying to do things, which were not
					straighforwardly possible to make people&apos;s life easier. which we
					could achieve by automating the headfull browser actions, not exactly
					this but something along these lines, which became the MVP among
					it&apos;s competitors. So I built many features with combination of
					queues, workers with third party APIs and automations and this was one
					of the biggest learning experience not because the tech was cool
					(which was actuallyüòâ)! but because of this app was pushing beyond
					software developers thinking that we can build something like which I
					was building.
				</p>
				<h3 className='text-lg font-bold mb-4 text-white'>
					Major App Features Design
				</h3>
				<p className='mb-4 text-justify'>
					One more thing which was challenging was to design several features
					like Workspaces, in which I had the chance to revamp the entire
					functioning of the app which was based on user level, I had to shift
					it to workspace level, which was a huge task, but I did it with the
					help of the feedback and discussions with the new manager I got in
					this new product! Another such feature was implementing an entire
					process/progress tracking of the process of google workspace account
					exports to third party cold email outreach tools (one of the main
					feature of the app). These features helped me to understand the
					correct usecase and power of the queueing architecture when working
					with multiple microservices. This was one of the coolest things I had
					ever worked on!

					What did I learn overall! üéì
				</h2>
				<p className='mb-4 text-justify'>
					During my internship at Reachinbox, I had the opportunity to work on
					several exciting projects that significantly enhanced my backend
					development skills. üöÄ I was responsible for developing and
					maintaining APIs, optimizing database queries, and ensuring the
					overall performance and scalability of the backend systems. ‚ö° This
					experience allowed me to gain hands-on experience with Node.js,
					Express.js, and SQL, and I was able to contribute to the successful
					deployment of several key features. üíª
				</p>
				<p className='mb-4 text-justify'>
					One of the highlights of my internship was collaborating with a
					talented team of developers and learning from their expertise. üë• I
					participated in code reviews, sprint planning, and daily stand-ups,
					which helped me understand the importance of effective communication
					and teamwork in a professional setting. Overall, my internship at
					Reachinbox was an invaluable experience that provided me with the
					skills and knowledge needed to excel in my future career as a backend
					developer. üåü
